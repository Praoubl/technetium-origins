# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  # push:
  #   branches: [ "master" ]
  # pull_request:
  #   branches: [ "master" ]
  
  push:
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/tags
    tags:
      - 'v*' # Push events to matching v*, i.e. v1.0, v20.15.10

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:
