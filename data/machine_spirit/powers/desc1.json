	"description":"While possessing a body, crouch to integrate redstone from your inventory, up to 14 total. This is in addition to the redstone originally used in the creation of the body. Below 4 redstone, you are partially blinded and cannot sprint. Above 9 redstone, you emit particles and have 2/3rds of a Night Vision effect, but your redstone will slowly decay (tÂ½ = 1 day). Your hunger bar refills at a rate proportional to your current redstone amount. You can always harvest redstone blocks, and do so very quickly.",
